Anvil uses LuaSnip as the snippet engine, and has support for vscode and LSP snippets out of the box. Adding more snippets is as simple as editing a ![json file](./snippets/javascript.json "link to javascript.json file containing example snippets") file while more advance/smart snippets can be written in Lua using LuaSnip.

*** StatusLine

Awesome StatusLine implemented in lua, without any plugin dependencies.

- Current mode indicator
- Current file path including unwritten state and read only indicator
- Buffer list ( use `<Leader> + b` to show and switch between previous and next buffer using `[b` and `]b`)
- Stats related to diagnostics (number of Errors `E`, Warnings `W`, Information `I` and Hints `H`)
- Language Server status
- File encoding, format ant type information
- File position indicators (current file progress + cursor coordinates)

An accent color is applied to the statusbar depending on current mode. The color is applied to Mode, Current Buffer, file format, and cursor position indicator sections of the statusline.

** Directory Structure:

Anvil has a very simple directory structure to make it easy to understand, navigate and extend.

** Goals

To create a highly extensible neovim configuration that can easily be adapted as an IDE for any programming language via LSP while staying light and as close to vanilla neovim as possible. This distribution aims to be a non intrusive, solid base which the user can easily customize to fit their workflow needs.
